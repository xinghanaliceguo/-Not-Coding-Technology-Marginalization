# *BridgElder* Software Application Design Project
```
I did this project in my second year of college.
Although the data analysis in this project was basic without complicated codings, 
the results shaped our minds and changed the whole direction of the project.
It was also the first time I realized how data analytics discover insights beyond the human mind
and shape people’s understanding of the world. Hence, I decided to share this project here with you.

After the COVID-19 outbreak, China adopted a stringent policy where everyone must show a QR code on their phone to enter public venues. When watching my grandparents struggling to navigate their smartphones and feeling embarrassed to bother me to teach them, I felt so sad. This made me rethink the relationship between business, technology, and society. Technology should cater to them rather than them adapting to it. This motivated me to conduct this product design program.

My original plan was to create a web plugin, which can trigger a simpler flow of usage of apps on phones. In other words, we wanted to create an elderly phone containing the rich functions of a smartphone.

To test the viability of our idea, we connected with 500+ seniors (from 55 to 80 years old) through questionnaires and in-person interviews. When I analyzed the data collected, I was totally shocked. **Over 70% of elderlies clearly expressed that they would like to take time to learn new technology. Over 85% of elderlies had difficulties finding tutorials and 60% of them felt embarrassed to bother their children or other people to teach them.** We also designed some text questions in the questionnaires. I cries when I saw an old adult trying to express “Don’t give up on us” in a careful and humorous tone. In addition,**about 167 old adults said that they don’t like our ideas because a simpler version would make them seem more dumped.** Then I realized that most people including me still held the wrong preconceptions against old adults, regarding them as frugal and reluctant to change.

My idea was challenged but I was very grateful that the seniors would like to share their thoughts with us. They reminded me how important to put myself in their shoes so that I can thoughtfully consider the underlying causes of the challenging situations and provide workable solutions for the challenges facing them.

Then, we reorganized our thoughts to seek more justice and liable solutions. On the technology front, most technology today was not inclusive enough, which worsened the plight of underrepresented people. In the end, we designed an application tool that contained tutorials for current technology, including software applications and other technology products. The aim of our project is to reduce the social marginalization of the elderly and advocate public be attentive to elderly mental care issues. The truly reassuring is that our idea had the support of our clients -- older adults.

**Thank you for reading this story. I absolutely appreciate that.**
